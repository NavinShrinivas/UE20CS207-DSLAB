# UE20CS207-DSLAB
Repo containing all programs as part of UE20CS207 course which is a data structures lab in PESU.

Understanding the programs in this repo : the number the file name begin with is the program it belongs to , the gitignore will not let object/exe files get to the repo hence , you are required to compile all the programs yourself.

DO NOT SIMPLY COPY CODES FROM HERE!!! , I have created this repo for my use only , If you got your hands on this link , its solely for referring only , If you copy and 
get caught for plagiarism it's on you xD.

I maintin all the code with such structure cus it comes in handy [i.e it's not for you], Usually during final project or some other course which needs these 
programs , and githubs search function comes in really handy for such times.its
I'll also attach the questions in text format in tasks.txt in each weeks folder
