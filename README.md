# UE20CS207-DSLAB
Repo containing all programs as part of UE20CS207 course which is a data structures lab in PESU.

Understanding the programs in this repo : the number the file name begin with is the task it belongs to. 
the gitignore will not let object/exe files get to the repo hence , you are required to compile all the programs yourself.

I'll also attach the questions in text format in tasks.txt in each weeks folder
